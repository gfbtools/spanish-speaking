      "formality": "In Spain, lunch is 2–4pm and dinner 9–11pm — significantly later than English norms. Shops and businesses often close 2–5pm for the afternoon break. Medical appointments in the public system (Seguridad Social) may require advance booking.",
      "gestures": "In Spain, time references often include 'a mediodía' (at noon/midday) as a common reference point. 'Por la tarde' in Spain typically means afternoon AND early evening.",
      "regional_variations": "Spain uses the 24-hour clock more commonly in everyday speech than Latin America: 'Son las quince horas' (3pm) is normal in announcements. Days of the week are never capitalised in Spanish.",
      "distincion": "Days with 'c' or 'z': 'lunes, martes, miércoles' — note 'miércoles' has no /θ/ issue, but 'diciembre' (December) features the Castilian /θ/: [diˈθjembɾe]."
