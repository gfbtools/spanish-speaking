      "formality": "In Puerto Rico, physical descriptions are very casual and affectionate. 'Flaco/a' (skinny) is used freely without negative connotation. 'Bien' replaces 'muy' as an intensifier: 'bien alto', 'bien simpático'.",
      "gestures": "Puerto Ricans are expressive and animated when describing people — hands and facial expressions add a lot of meaning. Mimicking the described person's mannerisms is common and humorous.",
      "regional_variations": "'Chévere' means cool, great, or awesome and is widely used in PR. 'Los ojos marrones' is used in PR instead of 'cafés'. 'Trigueño/a' describes a medium-brown skin tone and is a common, respectful descriptor."
