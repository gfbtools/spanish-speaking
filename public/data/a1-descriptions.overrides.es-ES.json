      "formality": "In Spain, 'majo/a' (nice, pleasant) is a very common adjective not used in Latin America. Physical descriptions in Spain tend to be more direct. 'Guapo/a' is used more freely as a term of address ('Oye, guapo') than in Mexico.",
      "gestures": "Spaniards are expressive but in a different register to Latin Americans — volume and directness are both higher. Describing someone's appearance is done openly and is not considered rude.",
      "regional_variations": "In Spain, 'marrón' is standard for brown (eyes, hair) — not 'café'. 'Rubio/a' for blonde is universal. 'Pecoso/a' (freckled) is commonly heard given higher rates of fair skin in northern Spain.",
      "distincion": "Key adjectives to note for /θ/: 'inteligente' has no /θ/ issue, but 'capaz' [kaˈpaθ] (capable) and 'feliz' [feˈliθ] (happy) do. Practice these once comfortable with the basics."
