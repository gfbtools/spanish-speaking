      "gestures": "Puerto Ricans may use 'bregar' (to deal with, to handle) when talking about numbers in context — 'Tengo que bregar con eso' (I have to deal with that). Numbers in addresses sometimes use English street names.",
      "regional_variations": "Many Puerto Ricans switch to English numbers when giving phone numbers or addresses, especially with younger speakers. Both are perfectly acceptable — '55 / fifty-five' are interchangeable."
