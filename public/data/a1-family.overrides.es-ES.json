      "formality": "In Spain, 'vosotros' is used for informal plural address — 'vosotros tenéis' rather than 'ustedes tienen'. Family structures have modernised significantly; nuclear families are increasingly common, especially in cities.",
      "family_values": "Family Sunday lunches (comidas del domingo) remain a strong tradition. It's common for adult children to live with parents into their late 20s due to housing costs, especially in Madrid and Barcelona.",
      "regional_variations": "You'll hear 'tío/tía' used casually between friends (like 'mate' or 'dude' in English) — context makes it clear whether it means uncle/aunt or just a friend. 'Chaval' is common slang for a young person or kid."
    },
    "distincion": "In Castilian Spanish, 'c' before 'e/i' and 'z' are pronounced /θ/ (like English 'th'). So 'gracias' sounds like 'graTHias'. This is the key pronunciation marker of es-ES."
