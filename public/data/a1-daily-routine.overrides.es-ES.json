      "formality": "Spanish daily routines run significantly later than in the UK or US: breakfast 8–9am, lunch 2–3pm (the main meal), dinner 9–11pm. 'El aperitivo' (pre-lunch drink and snacks) is common on weekends.",
      "gestures": "Yawning and stretching when talking about waking up is universal. In Spain, people often mime coffee-drinking when discussing morning routines.",
      "regional_variations": "'La siesta' is less common in modern urban Spain than the stereotype suggests — most working people take a lunch break but not a formal nap. However, shops still close 2–5pm in many towns.",
      "distincion": "'Acostarse' [akosˈtaɾse] vs 'despertarse' [despeɾˈtaɾse] — no /θ/ issue in these verbs, but 'almorzar' [almoɾˈθaɾ] features the Castilian /θ/ in the stem."
