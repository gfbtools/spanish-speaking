      "formality": "In Spain, phone numbers are typically read in pairs: '612 34 56 78' → 'seis-uno-dos, treinta y cuatro, cincuenta y seis, setenta y ocho'. Addresses use 'número' often abbreviated as 'nº'.",

      "regional_variations": "Spanish postcodes are 5 digits, read as groups. In Spain you'll see 'piso' (floor) and 'puerta' (door) as part of addresses: 'Calle Mayor, 5, 3º B' means Main Street 5, 3rd floor, apartment B.",
      "distincion": "Note 'cinco' /ˈθiŋko/ and 'cien' /ˈθjen/ with the Castilian /θ/ — a key pronunciation marker when saying numbers like 15 (quince /ˈkiŋθe/) and 50 (cincuenta /θiŋˈkwenta/)."
